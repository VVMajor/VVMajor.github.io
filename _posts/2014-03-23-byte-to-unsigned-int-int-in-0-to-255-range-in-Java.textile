title: byte to unsigned int in 0 to 255 range in Java
---

If You will try to print a byte value using System.out.println You may be surprised, that some bytes have negative values.
that is because a byte type in Java is signed.

In the code example below You can see, how You can to convert a byte value into unsigned int using binary addition operation with 0xFF value.

<pre><code>
public void examineDataBuffer( )
  {
    byte[] dBuf = xcursor.getDBytes(0,1024);
    for (int idBuf=0;idBuf<dBuf.length;idBuf++)
      {
        System.out.println(" "+idBuf+" "+(dBuf[idBuf] & 0xFF)+" "+Character.toString((char)(dBuf[idBuf]))  );
      }
  }
</code></pre>
