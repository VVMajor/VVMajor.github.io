title: Audio Monitoring Of A Link Status, Listen Sound Alarm In Windows During Network Disconnections
---

If Your internet connection is not always stable - sometimes you can be, like me, in such unpleasant situation:

 - You wait for a Skype message.
 - You don't look to your monitor. 
 - Your computer lost connection and are in the offline mode.
 - And You don't realize it, until You clap eyes many hours later.

With my simple command file You can audio monitoring a connection failures. Just run it and You will listen ticking sound every 3 second of your disconnection.
