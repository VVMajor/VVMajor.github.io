title: Removing u0000 Symbols From The String In Java
---

Pervasive SQL Java library function, which reads a database line returns String fields as Bytes Arrays.

If String field's content is shorter than maximal field length - unused characters will be filled with "\u0000" characters till full length.

To remove them from result String - You must replace them to "nothing", or later You can encounter a problems, for example while saving this String as JSON field.

Ok, it's quite simple:

<pre><code>
String(xcursor.getDBytes(92, 65), "cp1251").replaceAll("\u0000", "");
</code></pre>
